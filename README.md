# hey, im weijun

I'm the kind of person who spends way too much time thinking about machine learning, random tech stuff, and diving down bizarre rabbit holes. You’ll probably catch me getting lost in true crime podcasts or babbling about how the Egyptians didn’t actually build those pyramids.

Just wrapped up my FYP! It’s [ASLR with MobileNetV2 and MediaPipe](https://github.com/prxyn/ASL-Transfer-Learning-MediaPipe), feel free to check it out. 

Not working on anything major at the moment, but I’m always tinkering with new tech, digging into algorithms, AI models, and exploring weird tech concepts — the kind of stuff that makes your brain hurt in a good way.

Speaking of weird thoughts, ever wondered how many blocks were laid per hour when you consider 2.3 million blocks used to build the pyramids over 27 years? That works out to about 9.7 blocks per hour. And they’re saying “slaves” built that? 🤔

If you’re into tech rabbit holes, real-life mysteries, or just wanna talk about the Sumerians, hit me up.
